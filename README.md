# Extra Slot Andrew
Andrew, one of the famous Sonic recolors, gets coded with a new moveset into Sonic 3 A.I.R.

**PLEASE READ: Extra Slot Andrew is tested for the latest stable release of Sonic 3 A.I.R (v22.09.10.0) and might not work properly on the preview/test version(s)!**

**This mod is in BETA, there might be bugs, and the following features have yet to be added.**

## Features
- All sprites, including save select, signpost, end credits have been accounted for
- Andrew has a complete new set of sprites for his super form, modified from Sonic 3D in 2D's. (Thanks, Sotaknuck!)
- Should be compatible with most mods that add new features to ES characters (such as Sonic 3D in 2D stars)
- Partnering with Tails (won't be compatible with any other ES characters based on Tails, sorry)
