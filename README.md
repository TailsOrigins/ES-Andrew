# Extra Slot Andrew
Andrew, one of the famous Sonic recolors, gets coded with a new moveset into Sonic 3 A.I.R.

**PLEASE READ: Extra Slot Andrew is tested for the latest stable release of Sonic 3 A.I.R (v22.09.10.0) and might not work properly on the preview/test version(s)!**

**AND NOTE THIS IS A PASSION PROJECT. THIS PROJECT'S PROGRESS MAY BE HALTED AT ANY POSSIBLE TIME. BUT, I WILL TRY MY BEST TO KEEP THIS UPDATED.
FOR BIG UPDATES CHECK OUT [Aedchronium](https://twitter.com/Aedchronium)'S TWEETS.**


**This mod is in BETA, there might be bugs, and the following features have yet to be added.**

## Features
- All sprites, including save select, signpost, end credits have been accounted for
- Andrew has a complete new set of sprites for his super form, modified from Sonic 3D in 2D's. (Thanks, Sotaknuck!)
- Should be compatible with most mods that add new features to ES characters (such as Sonic 3D in 2D stars)
- Partnering with Tails (won't be compatible with any other ES characters based on Tails, sorry)
_____
Andrew's Moveset:

- Andrew has the special move of stomping. There's no real practical use, it's just for the funny.
- He can also break Knuckles walls, because yes.
- Andrew will peelout by default.
- Andrew *cannot* use the Insta-Shield or the Dropdash.

This mod requires the [ESU Framework](https://sonic3air.boards.net/thread/28/esu-framework) in order for it to work. Put it below this mod as well as any other extra character mods.
